## An Introduction

Hello to whoever (or is it whomever? I don't really know) is reading this, my name is Devin and this is my place to share thoughts. Some of my thoughts will be long and technical, others will be short and to a point, but at the end of the day they'll just be my thoughts. My goal here is not to write interesting content for people, this is a selfish endeavor so please do not expect much me.

I ask that if you see something you disagree with to tell me, you probably have a good reason too. 

With that being said, **welcome!**	/
