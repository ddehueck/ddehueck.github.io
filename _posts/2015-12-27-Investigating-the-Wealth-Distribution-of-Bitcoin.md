## Investigating the Wealth Distribution of Bitcoin

I have two questions I want to be answered when it comes to wealth distribution of Bitcoin:

1. What does the current distribution of wealth look like today?
2. What should the wealth distribution of Bitcoin look like?

These two questions are important because it allows us to glance into the health of the Bitcoin economy. Will we find a that just a few bitcoin addresses own a significant portion of the 15 million Bitcoin in circulation? And maybe more importantly, what does this distribution of wealth mean for the future of Bitcoin? All these ideas can help us understand the Bitcoin economy in which only a few of us exist within.

### What does the current distribution of wealth look like today?

To get an answer to this question we'll have to dig into the blockchain. Find every address and sort that address. Seems simple enough, but it may take a while plus I'll need to get the blockchain in a nice parsable format and I don't think any API's will allow me to easily access this information.

Oooooo I can probably make some cool looking graphs!

### What should the wealth distribution of Bitcoin look like?

This question could be answered purely philosophically, but I think the best way to approach this question is to look for problems in the current distribution of wealth. I do expect to find addresses belonging to companies and addresses belong to some very early adopters, namely Satoshi. But what if we find something like 70% of all Bitcoin is owned by just 5% of Bitcoin addresses. I doubt that would be a good thing. Also, one important thing to consider in this investigation is if it's possible to trace back any address to a specific entity. I do know of blockchain explorer sites that list the 'Ten wealthiest addresses' and things like that, so it's not too unlikely that someone has spent the time to find out who owns which address.

I'm doing this investigation because I don't think anyone else has done it and it feels like it should be done. I hope to find some cool things and learn something along the way. Cheers! /
