## Thoughts on how Bitcoin development is evolving

The current block size debate is beginning to turn productive. No, we haven't reached a solution yet, but the nature of Bitcoin development is beginning to evolve. 

Let's take a look at how Bitcoin development has been done in the past.
In the very early days, Bitcoin development was done via SourceForge but then moved to Github in favor of Github's features and reliability. If you wanted to get involved in Bitcoin development here was the place. This was the origin of Bitcoin Core. 

Bitcoin Core has been the only standard implementation of Bitcoin. If you wanted Bitcoin you wanted Bitcoin Core. Since the surrounding block size debate there more implementations of Bitcoin have merged. Of these new implementations are: [BitcoinXT](https://bitcoinxt.software/), [Bitcoin Unlimited](http://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/), and even more recently [Bitcoin Classic](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic). Bitcoin is evolving and it's beautiful. What we are seeing is the first centralized implementations of the Bitcoin Protocol within the decentralized network that is Bitcoin. And no this is not a bad thing. Far from it.

I would make the case that Bitcoin development has been far too centralized and now the community is forcing it to change. Having one main implementation of Bitcoin is almost damning to Bitcoin as a whole. It creates a central point of failure that needs to be avoided. Sure anyone can submit an issue or a pull request to Bitcoin Core, but only [seven people](https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/people) are actually a part of the Bitcoin (Core) organization on Github. This means what is actually included in Bitcoin Core is up to these seven people. Not the users. Not the companies. Not the miners. Just those seven people. Don't get me wrong Bitcoin Core has done an excellent job maintaining Bitcoin and should be commended for that. Now Bitcoin is growing and it's time for a stronger base.

Looking forward, I can envision the scope of Bitcoin development containing not just one implementation but many. Users will have choices, miners will have choices, and developers will have choices. And the most amazing part of this notion is the fact that these implementations can coexist. The incentives provided by the Bitcoin network will ensure this. Now, what's outside of this scope of implementation is the community. I'm talking about the forums, the facebook groups, the chatrooms, etc. These are the real places decisions are made and these too must become decentralized. As Aaron Shwartz said: 

>"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves."

Information concerning changes that would affect the entire Bitcoin network needs to be able to be received by everyone. No exceptions. Projects like [DATT](http://datt.co/) and [Open Bazaar](https://openbazaar.org/) are prime examples of leading with code. These are all steps bringing us closer to where Bitcoin needs to be.

**What we need now is civility.** It is unfortunate that changes in the Bitcoin development community as a result of the block size debate has caused us to devolve into senselessness we often find in politics. All sides are guilty, some more than others, but what is important is how we can come together to solve the challenging problems facing Bitcoin. Let's start working on that.
