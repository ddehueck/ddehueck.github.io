            <h2>Summary<br>__<br></h2>
            <p>A Boston University student interested in machine learning research, crypto-currency, web development, and mathematics.</p>
            
            <h2>Description<br>__<br></h2>
            <p>I program a lot - usually in Python or Javascript. I've also worked with Java, C, C++, and of course HTML/CSS. Some of my favorite frameworks include - PyTorch for deep learning or neuroevolution - NodeJS, ExpressJS, Django, and &lt;insert some frontend JS framework here/&gt; for web development. <a href="https://github.com/ddehueck">You can find my Github here.</a></p>
            
            <h2>What I'm doing now - summer 2018<br>__<br></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing my PyTorch NEAT implementation into a sophisticated open source project.</li>
                <li>Conducting independent research into catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.</li>
                <li>Continuing a web development project with Dr. Rudolph in Boston University's School of Public Health.</li>
                <li>Taking online courses to reinforce ML fundamentals.</li>

            <h2>Papers Read<br>__<br></h2>
            <p>I make an effort to read 5-10 machine learning research papers a week. I've decided to list and briefly comment on the ones that catch my eye. <a href="./papers-read.html">Check them out here.</a></p>

            <h2>Why is your website so ... plain?<br>__<br></h2>
            <blockquote>"Remove what's not substantive. It's a process that can be painful as it consists of letting go, giving up. But, itâ€™s also very demanding as minimalism requests a certain level of perfection. Every element must have its sense, its utility, its intrinsic beauty."</blockquote>
