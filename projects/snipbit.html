            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>This began when my interest in Bitcoin and blockchain tech lead to me to this month-long online hackathon. In this hackathon, I joined a person set on building a micropayment platform for online content producers. Essentially, we wanted to realize the promise of micropayments that digital currency evangelists had made. The platform ended up as an API accessed through a chrome extension (see <a href="https://youtu.be/kSFwqTBYFxw">demo video</a>), both of which I built. After placing third in the hackathon we decided to develop this further which culminated in a presentation to the venture capital firm Boost VC. Unfortuently, we were turned down by Boost VC, but it was a seriously insightful experience for me as a junior in high school.</p>
