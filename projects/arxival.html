        	<h1>Arxival.org</h1>
        	<p>A 'featurized' <a href="https://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a> to make keeping up with research papers simpler and more organized.</p>

        	<h2>Why I made this</h2>
			<p>As I wanted to expose myself to the research side of computer science and specifically, machine learning, I decided to start using <a href="https://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>. I quickly found it difficult to navigate the site and keep track of papers. From that frustration <a href="https://arxival.org/">arxival.org</a> was born.</p>

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Easily navigate through arxiv's many subjects.</li>
				<li>Save the subject feeds that are important to you to view in your dashboard.</li>
				<li>Save the papers you find interesting in a  personal library.</li>
				<li>Search through papers with all the filtering power of the arxiv API</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What is it built with</h2>
			<p>NodeJS, ExpressJS, Pug, JQuery, CSS. <a href="https://github.com/ddehueck/arxival">View it on Github</a></p>

			<h2>What does it look like</h2>
